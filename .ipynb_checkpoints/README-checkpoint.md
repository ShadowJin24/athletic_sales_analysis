# athletic_sales_analysis

The code file to run is <athletic_sales_analysis_edited.ipynb> for the assignment. The file <athletic_sales_analysis.ipynb> was
the starter code provided and was kept in the folder for reference.

This code was to do data analysis on atheletic sales for the years of 2020 and 2021 which was provided in the Soruce folder.
The files were brought in and stored into two dataframes of which was combined later into one dataframe by concating the second
file's rows into the first file. The dataframe column of dates was converted to a datetime datatype inorder to do some data analysis.
Groupby and Pivot was utilized in the dataframe to see the units sold and total sales based on region and by retailer. 
Groupby and Pivot was then utilized to see specifically only Women's Athletic Footware data. Daily and Weekly bins were generated to 
see the total sales daily and by weeks for the Women's Athletic Footware data.
